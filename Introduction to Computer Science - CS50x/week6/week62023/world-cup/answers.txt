Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

In the 3 predictions whit the smallest simulations France never appeared in top 7, sometimes never appeared at all.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems to stabilized after 1000 simulations, besides France not appearing in top 7 (it appeared 8th), so i would call 1000 simulations good enough.
