If the aura was determined with the average of the valence, energy and danceability this person would
have had a pretty excited and happy aura.
I think, in order to calculate something like an 'aura', we first should collect more data about when the person listened
to what music and group the music into 'cronological boxes' because it is not possible to a human to be an entire
year in one mood. Then I think we should give some weight to this different data, like a number between 0 and 1 to
multiply it by. To do that I think we should ask 500 people to listen to some kind of music and then ask for them to
explain and characterize the aura/mood they're in. WIth that information and the music they listened to we then use
a computer to get us "the line that best adjust to our cloud of data", or basically, get us the best numbers to use.
And then, analysing the 'cronological boxes' of music with our computer-generated estimators, we could describe the
different auras the spotify user had passed thorough the year. Sorry for the long text ;)
