sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: really good in the best case cenarios, i.e. sorted files,
most notable while the size of the data base increases.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: keeps a consistent amount of time to files either reversed, sorted or randomized.
In the bigger sample even takes more time with the sorted file than the other ones (at least in my pc),
so sorted files don't represent the "best case cenario" because there isnÂ´t one.
Also is the most efficent in big data bases.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: also consistent in every type of organized (or desorganized) file,
but less effient than the merge sort.
